Your Maven cache is corrupted on the second machine. The JAR can't be opened, that's why you get this exception.

You can fix that by running this command on the second machine for that project:

mvn dependency:purge-local-repository
If that doesn't work, try remove your local repo on that machine (~/.m2/repository/org/springframework) and run mvn package again.
